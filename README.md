# Meditation timer 

How nice could it be to completely disconnect from your phone while meditating, and being noticed when the time is up with a "real" bell, vibrating through your room, instead of a digital one? We built a physical meditation timer that can do it! Using Arduino, we managed to let a Tibetian bowl play itself after setting a time.
